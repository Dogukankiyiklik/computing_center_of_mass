# Computing Blob Number And Center Of Mass for Each Blob
## Description
This C++ program reads an text file and take an blobs form the text file, then calculates the number of pixels in each blob, and computes the center of mass for each blob.

## Features
Reads input from a text file.
Computes the number of pixels in each blob.
Calculates the center of mass for each blob.
Generates an information table showing blob number, pixel count, and center of mass' x and y coordinates.

## Executing program
Create an txt file and draw some geometrical shapes with 'X' character that you want to calculate to center of mass of shapes.
Then add that txt file that you have created in the same directory with the cpp file of this code.
Run the program and enter name of the txt file that you have created.
